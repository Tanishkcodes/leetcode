        Explanation:
        1. a ^ b → XOR operation adds bits where only one of them is 1 (ignores carry)
        2. a & b → AND operation finds positions where both bits are 1 (this is the carry)
        3. << 1 → shift carry left by 1 to add it in the next higher bit
        4. Recursive call → we repeat the process until carry (b) becomes 0
